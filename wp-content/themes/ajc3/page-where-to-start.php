			With an ever-growing collection of pieces sourced in the UK by our expert founder Olly, we have pieces to meet even the most specific brief. On our site you will find an extensive and eclectic collection of pieces that have been selected to intrigue and delight.</p>
			<p>We aim to bring antique jewellery to life; to pass on anecdotes and provide information on the provenance, design and history of our pieces. The moment you buy a piece of antique jewellery you inherit a rich heritage and become the author of the next chapter in its story.</p>
			<p>We are shameless antique enthusiasts and will resist listing hundreds of reasons an antique engagement ring is better than grabbing one off the shelf.
