				<h2>Quality</h2>
				<p>We are proud of our collection, which we feel represents the very best antique jewellery from across the ages. Under no circumstances will you find any reproductions and, unless stated clearly, all our items are in very good condition and 100% original, free from enhancements.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="half">
				<h2>Rarity</h2>
				<p>Antique jewellery is a finite resource and it is becoming increasingly hard to source really fine examples. We have to scour far and wide to unearth the rare and unusual (some weeks we are empty handed) and those items that eventually make it into our collection are the cream of the crop.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="half middle">
				<h2>Expertise</h2>
				<p>With over 40 years of experience in the London trade, our founder Olly Gerrish is one of the UK's foremost antique jewellery authorities, with the best trained eye around. This gives her unparalleled access to the best pieces on the market from which she meticulously makes her selection.</p>

				<h2>Peace of Mind</h2>
				<p>Investing in a piece of antique jewellery can be a daunting process. We value our customers' peace of mind above all and that is why we uphold a culture of trust and decency at all times. Should a customer for any reason be unhappy with their purchase we will not hesitate to offer them a 14 day full money back guarantee.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="half">
				<h2>Personal Touch</h2>
				<p>Finding the perfect piece should be a fun and enlightening experience. To achieve this we are here to lend our customers a helping hand and provide impartial expert advice. Building lasting relationships is far more important to us than a quick sale.</p>
