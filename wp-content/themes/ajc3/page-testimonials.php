			<blockquote>Just received my wonderful Edwardian necklace. Superb. As was the service I received from Matt and Olly. I found the efficiency, care and help was second to none.The personal service from Olly was five star and am now looking on this wonderful site for other items. Certainly recommended to others, not only because of above qualities but the fine, diverse jewels on the site.</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="space-above">We are absolutely thrilled with our first antique ring and for having found you!! Your service is unbelievable, even down to the hand written note. The website is excellent, very easy to use with fantastically clear photos and descriptions for each item. Brilliant!! we have already recommended you to our friends!!</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="space-above">My words can't possibly do justice to the AJC. It is my go-to site for Victorian and Georgian jewelry. For any jewelry lover, it is a gem of a find! Having purchased a couple of pieces, the delight of receiving them pales in comparison to the actual pieces themselves. Both Olly and Matt are beyond gracious with their time, their expertise and their customer service. I can only hope to be the recipient of more pieces in the very near future.</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="space-above">I found The AJC when looking for a locket for my daughter’s 18th birthday. The pictures of all of the pieces are crystal clear and I found a beautiful Edwardian silver enameled locket, which I bought immediately. The service is spot on, right down to the handwritten compliment slip which came with my purchase (how many other companies take the time to say a personal thank you for a web purchase these days?). The locket arrived very quickly in the post and it surpassed the pictures on the website. I have no hesitation in recommending Olly and her shop to anyone and it will be my first port of call in the future when I’m looking for something special.

			<blockquote class="space-above">I was impressed with the whole experience. A very user-friendly website with clear pictures, excellent quality of product and fast delivery. I have already recommended you to three of my colleagues.</blockquote>
			<div class="text-right">&mdash; Tom</span>, <em>London, UK</em></div>

			<blockquote class="space-above">The clearest sign of a company's trustworthiness, I think, is how it deals with sales that don't go as hoped, and I couldn't ask for the AJC to have dealt with this one better.  I'll be buying from them again.</blockquote>
			<div class="text-right">&mdash; Thomas</span>, <em>Manchester, UK</em></div>


			<blockquote class="space-above">It was a pleasure to deal with Olly who answered my queries promptly, and took time and trouble to give a wonderful, personal service. I shall certainly recommend you to my friends, and look forward to finding other wonderful, individual objects from you!</blockquote>

			<blockquote class="space-above">I am delighted to have found your site... a banquet of jewelry. I found your site user friendly and can hardly wait to buy my next item. I want to thank you for quickly answering my emails - you have excellent customer service - and for mailing my item to Canada so quickly. It arrived well packaged and undamaged. I have complete trust in you and will happily recommend you to my friends. </blockquote>

			<div class="text-right">&mdash; Eileen,</span> Alberta, <em>Canada</em></div>

			<blockquote class="space-above">Last summer I came across the AJC online when I was planning a visit to London. As some items posted on their website attracted me so much, I contacted them by e-mail finding them very helpful. When I actually visited their shop at Grays and saw Olly and Matt, they were ready to show the items for my interests; I found them looking more beautiful than I had imagined. Then I bought a Victorian brooch. Recently I have bought a fabulous Victorian ring via their web site. They were very kind and their responses were very quick. I really love the ring!</blockquote>
			<div class="text-right">&mdash; Noriko</span>, <em>Tokyo, Japan</em></div>

			<blockquote class="space-above">Having dreamt of a Georgian cluster ring for years, I spied one on the AJC website – lovely clear pictures from several angles, good description and (fatal!) a friendly invitation to “arrange a viewing”. What a clever system! I emailed a request to see three rings on my next visit to London, and so I met Olly. A woman with an obvious passion for and deep understanding of her subject, she was able to tell me all about the rings – the differences between them, the shapes of the stones and so on – and even taught me how to use her loupe. It all felt very special and very much in keeping with such a significant purchase – and my fabulous Georgian ring sits on my finger as I type! My only concern is how to stay away from that tempting website...</blockquote>
