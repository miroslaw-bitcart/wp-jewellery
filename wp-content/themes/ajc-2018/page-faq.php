			<a id="4"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">4. Why antique jewellery?</h3>
			<p>We belive that antique jewellery has an enduring charm and distinction that modern equivalents simply cannot match (don't get us started!).</p>
			<p>Antique jewellery is also an investment rather than an expense, with immediate advantages over other ways of investing for the future. It is cheaper to buy and sell through a dealer than an auction house with their spiralling commissions. A dealer's knowledge, experience and passion add value to a purchase which will give life long pleasure.</p>
			
			<a id="5"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">5. When was your jewellery made?</h3>
			<p>Our jewellery varies in age from the early 18th Century up until the 1960s and later. We have categorized our jewellery into different periods. Each period has many different designs and characteristics. These periods include Georgian, Victorian, Art Nouveau, Edwardian, Art Deco, Retro, Mid-Century and Modern.</p>
			<p><strong>Georgian Jewellery (1714-1830)</strong></p>
			<p>Georgian era jewellery is handmade, making the quality of each piece variable. Needless to say, Georgian jewellery is very rare. Often featuring nature-inspired designs such as leaves and birds, Georgian jewellery frequently includes precious stones.</p>
			<p><strong>Early Victorian, Romantic Jewellery (1839-1901)</strong></p>
			<p>Like jewellery of the Georgian era, early Victorian era jewellery features nature-inspired designs. Frequently, these designs would be delicately and intricately etched into gold. Lockets and brooches were popular everyday jewellery during the early Victorian era whereas colored gemstones and diamonds were worn during the evening.</p>
			<p><strong>Mid-Victorian, Grand Jewellery (1860-1880)</strong></p>
			<p>Because the Grand or Mid-Victorian era corresponded with the death of Queen Victoria&rsquo;s husband, many jewellery pieces have solemn, grave designs. Known as mourning jewellery, the pieces feature heavy, dark stones. Jet, onyx, amethyst, and garnet are frequently found in jewellery from this period. The jewellery also became especially creative during this period. More colorful designs were born featuring shells, mosaics and colorful gemstones.</p>
			<p><strong>Late Victorian, Aesthetic Jewellery (1885-1900)</strong></p>
			<p>During the Late Victorian or Aesthetic period, jewellers used diamonds and feminine, bright gemstones such as sapphire, peridot, and spinel. Star and crescent designs as well as elaborate hat pins were also popular.</p>
			<p><strong>Art Nouveau Jewellery (1890-1915)</strong></p>
			<p>Inspired by Rene Jules Lalique in France and other jewellers in America, Art Nouveau jewellery features natural designs such as flowers and butterflies.</p>
			<p><strong>Edwardian Jewellery (1901-1914)</strong></p>
			<p>The Edwardian period was born when Queen Victoria died and her son Edward became king. During this period, expensive gemstones such as diamonds, emeralds and rubies and elaborate designs were the fashion.</p>
			<p><strong>Art Deco Jewellery (1920-1935)</strong></p>
			<p>Influenced by African, Egyptian and Japanese themes, Art Deco jewellery is famous for its geometric designs, sharp lines, and bright colors. Bakelite, celluloid, eidl and doublets were used frequently during this era. Necklaces were long and bracelets were worn many at a time. Amber and murano beads were worn as well as chokers.</p>
			<p><strong>Retro Jewellery (1940s)</strong></p>
			<p>Inspired by Hollywood, Retro jewellery is colorful, bold and elaborate. Commonly worn were large cocktail rings, bracelets, watches, necklaces and charm bracelets.</p>

			<a id="6"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">6. How can you tell how old your jewellery is?</h3>
			<p>We use our vast knowledge to date each piece based on the item's materials, construction techniques, hallmarks, signatures, and cultural context. Some people may even refer to our ability to identify the age of our jewelry as diamond whispering! After decades of experience, vintage and antique pieces just speak to us, and by using our knowledge, experience and network of resources, we can usually identify the age of each item. While we cannot guarantee the exact age of each piece, we can determine to the best of our ability when it was likely manufactured and during which era it was designed.</p>

			<a id="7"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">7. Where do you find your jewellery?</h3>
			<p>This is the most frequently asked question and a highly guarded trade secret. We scour the earth for the most high quality and exquisite pieces so you don’t have to!</p>
			
			<a id="8"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">8. What conditions are your items in?</h3>
			<p>Our jewellery is in excellent condition, taking into account its age. We pride ourselves on selecting only the finest examples of antique jewellery. In exceptional circumstances when an item is not in excellent condition, we will mention it in our item descriptions. Of course, please do not hesitate to contact us if you wish to see some more hi-resolution images of the item or view the item in person at our shop.</p>

			<a id="9"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">9. How often do you get new jewellery?</h3>
			<p>We are always on the hunt for new treasures and update our websute with our new finds on a daily basis!</p>

			<a id="10"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">10. Are your diamonds conflict free?</h3>
			<p>Yes! Conflict diamonds or “blood diamonds” are illegally traded stones that were mined sometime in the last 50 years. These diamonds originated in countries such as Angola, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire) or The Republic of Congo, and were used to finance civil wars and deadly insurgencies. Because we only use antique and vintage diamonds that predate this period, our jewellery is completely conflict free. Initiatives such as the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme have been created in order to curb the dangerous blood diamond trade, however even this initiative is fraught with shortcomings. The only way to guarantee that a diamond is conflict free is to reuse vintage and antique diamonds that were mined prior to 1970...which is exactly what we do!</p>

			<a id="11"></a>
			<h3 class="gothic large-space-below">11. Do you Purchase Jewellery?</h3>
			<p>We are constantly looking for fine quality pieces to add to our collection. You can always rely on us to settle instantly and provide maximum discretion when doing so. If you have jewellery that you are considering selling, whether it’s an entire estate collection or just one piece, please fill in <a href="/sell-your-jewellery/">this form</a>. Please note we only buy items that are antique, ie. at least 50 years old, and in general we do NOT buy costume jewellery, loose coloured gemstones, pocket watches or watches.</p>
