			<p>Where we are based, Grays Antiques Center... Well, the distinctive red brick Grade 2 listed building was originally commissioned as a water closet showroom by John Bolding and Son. John Bolding was arch competitor of Thomas Crapper; a name associated with the modern lavatory!</p>
			<p>John Bolding took pride in erecting a building that was as handsome as it was functional. Bennie Gray adopted the same mentality when he embarked on transforming the crumbling WC showroom the site you see today. See... I may only be young, but I bet you didn't know that!</p>
