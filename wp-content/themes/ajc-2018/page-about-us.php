		<h2>Welcome to The Antique Jewellery Company.</h2>
		<h3 class="space-below">We are a family run company based in London with more than 40 years experience in the antique jewellery trade.</h3>

		<p>Founded in 2008 we provide our customers worldwide with unrivalled access to a high-quality and extensive collection of antique, vintage and estate jewellery, carefully sourced here in London.</p>
		<p>Our aim is to celebrate the best of antique jewellery, challenge preconceptions and reach out to new audiences who might not have considered buying antique before.</p>
		<p>We do not deal in reproductions or imitations - you can be assured of the quality and authenticity of all of our items. From Georgian, Victorian, Edwardian and Art Deco through to the retro fashions of the 1940s and 1950s we carefully select only the finest examples of antique jewellery.</p>
		<h3 class="space-below">We hope you enjoy discovering our pieces as much as we do!</h3>
