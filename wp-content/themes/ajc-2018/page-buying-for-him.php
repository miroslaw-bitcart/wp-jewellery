			<h2>Buying for Him</h2>
			<h3 class="space-below">Before you embark on buying jewellery for a man first consider how it will be received...</h3>
			<p>Would he appreciate a great pair of cufflinks, or might they be unwrapped, admired momentarily and then thrust into a pocket only to later get chewed up in the wash? If this scenario sounds familiar opt for a pair of modern cufflinks which can easily be replaced. Our pieces are unique and require care!

			<p>If you are buying cufflinks for him to wear at work they will need to be resilient.  We have lots of simple, hardwearing styles perfect to be worn everyday. If you are buying for more formal occasions you have greater scope to invest in elaborate designs.</p>

			<p>Antique jewellery makes a great style statement and can instantly transform a bland suit. Dress Sets are a fantastic place to start. Studded with diamonds and often incorporating enamel they bring a beaten up black tie to life. <small><a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/jewellery-type/mens-jewellery/dress-sets/' ) ); ?>">View our Dress Sets here</a>.</small></p>

			<p>It is sure to be a fun and enlightening process..</p>
