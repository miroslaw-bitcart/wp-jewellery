				<h2>Olly</h2>
				<p>
					As one of the most experienced and respected antique jewellery dealers in the UK, Olly knows a thing or two about the antique jewellery trade. Having worked her way up from the market-stalls of Portobello and Bermondsey in the 1970s to the bright lights of Bond Street and the world-famous <a href="http://www.graysantiques.com" target="_blank">Grays Antiques Centre</a> - turning down a role as head of jewellery at a major auction house along the way - Olly brings to the AJC an unrivalled eye for quality, expertise and customer service.<br><br><a href="<?php echo esc_url( home_url( '/world-of/ollys-story' ) ); ?>">Read Olly's story here <span class="x-small ion-chevron-right"></span></a>

				<h2>Matt</h2>
				<p>
					Matt first spotted the potential to bring Olly's existing antique jewellery business online and he began building The Antique Jewellery Company in 2008. With a background in art, design and techology, Matt brings a refreshingly disruptive stance to the trade and the way old jewellery should be presented to the world in the future.

				<h2>Zuleika</h2>
				<p>
					Zuleika joined the AJC in late 2016, following her marriage to Olly's son, Oliver. In her role as operations manager, Zu brings with her a wealth of experience having worked in the arts and antiques trade for several years. Amongst many things, Zu assures that our customers are happy, our items are beautifully photographed, described and packaged and sent out on time. She is also a very calming influence as the go-between for Olly and Matt! In short, Zu is an all action hero who makes the AJC tick!</p>
