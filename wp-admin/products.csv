32773	N/A 	Georgian Miniature Gold, Emerald & Diamond Ring	publish	sold	https://www.antiquejewellerycompany.com/shop/georgian-miniature-gold-emerald-diamond-ring	This really is a tiny ring. It will not fit on a little finger! I can only think that it was worn by a child. It is so pretty with four small rose cut diamonds and a central rectangular cut emerald. It could have ben a Christening present as it is in the shape of a cross. In the Catholic Church, green has a special meaning since it has always been considered the most natural and elementary colour in liturgy, hence the use of the emerald. It was made circa 1780.

5524	956C	N/A	publish	available	https://www.antiquejewellerycompany.com/shop/reverse-intaglio-rock-crystal-horses-head-cufflinks	A good pair of reverse intaglio rock crystal cufflinks. A reverse crystal intaglio is a rock crystal cabochon with an intaglio carved into the flat back. The intaglio was also painted realistically with oils so, that when viewed through the top, the image appears three-dimensional. Finally, the back was sealed in order to preserve the painted areas. The technique originated in Belgium c. 1860 and is attributed to an artist named Emile Marius Pradier. This technique was also practiced in England by Thomas Cook and his descendants who made crystals for Lambeth &amp; Co.\r\nProduction of a reverse crystal intaglio begins with the mining and cutting of fine rock crystal from Brazil or Madagascar. A well-formed cabochon is the key to a beautifully made reverse intaglio and the tedious process of hand polishing it to perfection had to be completed before the design work could begin. A watercolour of the image was painted on the underside of the cabochon and an oil and diamond dust mixture was used along with up to 250 scribing tools to carve the design into the interior of the crystal \x93\x85the deeper the carving the more pronounced trompe l\x92oeil effect.\x94 Once the carving was established the painting process began with extremely fine brushes and paint working in reverse to create incredibly detailed images.\r\nThe motifs most commonly found are sporting themes \x96 horses, dogs, foxes and birds. This relatively secret process passed through family members, so keeping it exclusive and expectations of quality were very high. They remained in fashion until poorly made glass and plastic imitations flooded the market c. 1920s. They were made circa 1900-1910. They are very collectable today, and are hard to find, especially in good condition.	2500	2500	N/A 	instock	23874,23875	simple	metals/rock-crystal/gold	edwardian	antique-cufflinks	male	N/A

In 1902 the French chemist Auguste Verneuil developed a process for producing synthetic sapphire crystals. In the Verneuil process, named after him, fine alumina powder is added to an oxyhydrogen flame, and this is directed downward against a mantle. The alumina in the flame is slowly deposited, creating a teardrop shaped ""boule"" of sapphire material. Artificial sapphire material is identical to natural sapphire, except it can be made without the flaws.

The stark grey wire is finely woven like lace and is light as air. Silesian Iron wire work dates to the late 1700\x92s. Pieces were made in Gleiwitz, Silesia, a narrow strip of land which is now part of Germany and Poland. In 1805 production of ironwork moved to Berlin and evolved in style.\r\nSimilar work originated in France as early as 1789, spurred by the French Revolution. The popularity of iron and steel jewellery is considered a result of wartime political and social climates as people were asked to give up their gold pieces to the war effort and were given iron jewellery in return. A lot has perished over the years so this chain is a rare historical survival of a lost art.	2950	2950	N/A 	instock	34327,34328	simple	iron-cut-steel	georgian	antique-chains	N/A	N/A

Other jewellers revived ancient techniques to create matte and shiny surfaces, depth and relief which were provided by corded wire, filigree and granulation.

In other words, she said, the colours stood for freedom and dignity, purity and hope.</p>"	3500	3500	N/A 	instock	36608,36588,36610,36609	simple	precious-stones/diamond/gold/metals/amethyst/peridot	edwardian	antique-necklaces	female	suffragette

It was made circa 18215. The roots of Berlin Iron Jewellery can be traced back to the establishment of the Royal Berlin Foundry in 1804. The Royal Berlin Foundry started with the production of iron goods such as vases, knife stands, candelabra, bowls, plaques and medallions, as well as more commercial articles such as fences, bridges and garden furniture. The first jewellery items, such as long chains with cast links, were produced in 1806.\r\n\r\nThe production of iron jewellery reached its peak between 1813 and 1815, when the Prussian royal family urged all citizens to contribute their gold and silver jewellery towards funding the uprising against Napoleon during the War of Liberation. In return the people were given iron jewellery such as brooches, finger rings and crosses. It became a symbol of patriotism and loyalty and with its obvious aesthetic appeal, became popular overnight.\r\nThis piece is a classic example and would fit well in a collection and can still be worn to great effect.	2750	2750	N/A 	instock	3784,3785,3786,3787,3788,3789	simple	iron-cut-steel	georgian	antique-lockets-pendants	female	N/A

It is hard to imagine how much work went in to creating cut steel jewellery. Each faceted and highly polished cut steel bead was riveted by hand. It must have taken hours and the result is stunning especially in candle light which is what was intended.\r\nWolverhampton in the Midlands was the centre for making cut steel jewellery. \r\nIn the 1800s it was fashionable for wealthy ladies to wear elaborate jewellery. It may have been that steel jewellery was worn during the day as imitation jewels for safety. It was fashionable and prized in its own right - and it could be very expensive. It is as collectable today as it was in the Georgian period.\r\n\r\n	975	975	N/A 	instock	17122,17121,17120	simple	iron-cut-steel	georgian	antique-bracelets-bangles	female	N/A

It is composed of long rectangular links with a key design interspersed with long oval links with an elongated star design. The technique used is called ""Niello"" and was practiced by French and Russian jewellers. They heated, to melting, a mixture of silver, copper, sulphur and lead to create a gunmetal or charcoal grey tone, and poured it on to silver which had previously been gouged with minute continuous patterns that were geometric or taken from nature. The jewel was then polished. This chain is in fine condition and even the dog clip bears niello work."	975	975	N/A 	instock	37324,37418	simple	silver/metals	edwardian	antique-chains	female	N/A

Rock crystal mined in Brazil and Madagascar was cut with diamond saws and then ground to the perfect cabochon. This procedure could take as many as twenty different grades of polish, and the entire process was done by hand. Once the stone was shaped, the design was drawn on the reverse side of the crystal with water colour. The image was then etched into the piece of stone with a scribe pencil.\r\n\r\nThe engraving began with handmade soft steel tools. The crystal was carved with a paste made from a combination of oil and diamond dust. When the image had been completed to the artist?s satisfaction, he began painting the crystal. Just as in the carving phase, the painting was done in reverse.\r\n\r\nHighly collectable, these pieces are a little work of art in themselves.	550	550	N/A 	instock	5273,5274,5275,5276	simple	metals/rock-crystal/gold	edwardian	antique-tie-pins	male	dandy-man

5508	513H/J	Victorian 15ct Gold Rock Crystal Yachting Cufflinks	publish	available	https://www.antiquejewellerycompany.com/shop/victorian-15ct-gold-rock-crystal-yachting-cufflinks	A rare pair of reverse intaglio rock crystal cufflinks with a yachting theme. The flags depict an anchor, a crown and the union jack. A reverse crystal intaglio is a rock crystal cabochon with an intaglio carved into the flat back. The intaglio was also painted realistically with oils so, that when viewed through the top, the image appears three-dimensional. Finally, the back was sealed in order to preserve the painted areas. The technique originated in Belgium c. 1860 and is attributed to an artist named Emile Marius Pradier. This technique was also practiced in England by Thomas Cook and his descendants who made crystals for Lambeth &amp; Co.\r\nProduction of a reverse crystal intaglio begins with the mining and cutting of fine rock crystal from Brazil or Madagascar. A well-formed cabochon is the key to a beautifully made reverse intaglio and the tedious process of hand polishing it to perfection had to be completed before the design work could begin. A watercolour of the image was painted on the underside of the cabochon and an oil and diamond dust mixture was used along with up to 250 scribing tools to carve the design into the interior of the crystal \x93\x85the deeper the carving the more pronounced trompe l\x92oeil effect.\x94 Once the carving was established the painting process began with extremely fine brushes and paint working in reverse to create incredibly detailed images.\r\nThe motifs most commonly found are sporting themes \x96 horses, dogs, foxes and birds. This relatively secret process passed through family members, so keeping it exclusive and expectations of quality were very high. They remained in fashion until poorly made glass and plastic imitations flooded the market c. 1920s. They were made circa 1880. These cufflinks are very collectable today.	1500	1500	N/A 	instock	5509,5510	simple	metals/rock-crystal/gold	victorian	antique-cufflinks	male	dandy-man

The millegraining of the metal edges allow the diamonds and gemstones to sparkle without competing with the reflected light from a highly polished platinum edge. It would make a pretty engagement ring.	675	675	N/A 	instock	38791,41918,38900,38896,38895,38894,38897,38898,38899,38901	simple	platinum/precious-stones/diamond/metals/gold	art-deco	antique-engagement-rings	female	N/A

It is a vitreous enamelling technique where the enamel is applied in cells, similar to cloisonn\xe9, but with no backing in the final product, so light can shine through the transparent or translucent enamel. It is in effect a miniature version of stained-glass and is considered very challenging technically. The technique is similar to that of cloisonn\xe9, but using a temporary backing that after firing is dissolved by acid or rubbed away. In the Art Nouveau period this technique was very popular and pieces in good condition such as this chain are hard to find."	1875	1875	N/A 	instock	39046,39044,39045,39047	simple	metals/silver/enamel	art-nouveau	antique-chains	N/A	N/A

It is very well made with fine engraved detail along the sides. The settings are properly filed and finished off on the reverse unlike modern pieces which are often crudely drilled. The front is millegrained which is an extremely tiny beaded detail that finishes an edge on a piece of jewellery. The detail is applied as a fine beaded texture on the platinum. The millegraining of the metal edges allow the diamonds and gemstones to sparkle without competing with the reflected light from a highly polished platinum edge. Altogether a stunning piece.	5250	5250	N/A 	instock	39589,39591,39590	simple	platinum/diamond/metals/sapphire	art-deco	antique-brooches	female	the-classics

Associated with the seasons, Demeter is depicted with sheaves of wheat, symbols of the harvest, that she holds in her hands and are woven through her hair like a crown. As the goddess of earth, she is intimately connected to the earth\x92s power for bearing fruit. This fertility connection is further opened up to encompass the notion of fertility as a whole. Thus, Demeter came to be known as the Greek goddess of marriage. The mount is 15ct gold Etruscan revival work which was initially researched by Fortunato and Castellani using their granulation skills and other ancient jewellery techniques. Depth and relief were provided by corded wire, filigree and granulation. Castellani\x92s work spread through Europe and the style was adopted most famously by Fontenay in France, John Brogden and Robert Phillips in London and by Carlo Giuliano, originally from Naples, now settled in London. Overall it is a beautiful piece and in excellent condition.	1875	1875	N/A 	instock	39593,39595,39594	simple	metals/gold	victorian	antique-brooches	female	N/A

It was made circa 1880.  ""Pools of light"" crystal orbs were wire wrapped instead of drilling, in order to keep the orbs intact. When you place a crystal orb on top of something, instead of looking through it, the light going into the orb from its surroundings still experiences that same lens-based refractive effect and so the light that comes out is diffused but it is also somewhat focused. Thus, a \x93pool of light\x94 appears on whatever surface is immediately adjacent to the orb.\r\nThat is why undrilled pools of light necklaces are much preferred and are more expensive.\r\nIn Chinese tradition, each crystal orb contains a bit of chi (good energy) within it, which would escape and be lost if the orb were to be drilled or otherwise damaged. Naturally it\x92s best to be wearing as much good chi as one possibly can!\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"	975	975	N/A 	instock	40072,40137,40138	simple	metals/silver/rock-crystal	victorian	antique-necklaces	female	wonder-room

No one piece is exactly the same as it was all hand made.	525	525	N/A	N/A	7408,7409,7410	N/A	metals/silver/gold	victorian	antique-bracelets-bangles	female	N/A

They are set with specimen fern agates. These were extremely popular in Georgian jewellery. No two agates are exactly alike. Over the years they have been referred to as either tree, picture or landscape agates due to the naturalistic patterns they portray. Ironically, they are not true agates but, instead, range from a translucent colourless to whitish-grey variety of chalcedony quartz, with markings known as dendrites, which derives from the Greek word ""dendron"" for tree. The plant-like structures in black and brown display an organic appearance, but the markings are actually inclusions with traces of iron or manganese, which crystallise inside the agate\x92s fine surface fractures and create the branch and single tree, or multiple woodsy, motifs. These earrings were made circa 1800-1820."	1875	1875	N/A 	instock	40640,40642,40641	simple	agate/metals/gold	georgian	antique-earrings	female	N/A

41300	116/J	Bernard Instone Silver, Amethyst, Green Garnet & Enamel ?Heart Shaped Pendant	publish	available	N/A	"A wonderful silver pendant that was made by Bernard Instone. \xa0Bernard Instone (1891\x971987) is a highly regarded and very collectable jeweller, designer and silversmith of the later British Arts and Crafts Instone was born in Kings Norton in Birmingham, and his artistic talent was apparent from a very early age. He was only twelve years old when he won a scholarship to the Birmingham school of jewellery,\xa0 \xa0where he studied under renowned Arts and Crafts jewellerArthur Gaskin. After leaving the School, Instone worked for a while for another renowned jeweller and craftsman, John Paul Cooper, and then\xa0studied in Berlin under Emil Lettre, Kaiser Wilhelm II\x92s Court goldsmith. In October 1913 he was back in England, and began part-time teaching at the Birmingham School of Jewellery. As well as making pieces for the Gaskins and Bernard Cuzner\xa0and other teachers at the school, he also made his first commissions at this time. In 1920 he set up his own jewellers and silversmith works , Langstone Silver Works in Digbeth in Birmingham. The company worked from there until 1954 when it moved to Lode Lane in Solihull. As well as making his own designs, Instone produced jewellery for other jewellers, such as Sibyl Dunlop. Records say that\xa0\x93he visited [Dunlop] every Friday at her shop in Kensington, supplying her with made up designs already marked up with the SD mark ready for the retail market and [in the] 1940s Liberty became a customer after 25 years of trying to sell to them.\x94 \xa0His two sons came to work in the business, and Instone retired in 1963 to the Cotswolds, where he died in 1987. Instone was strongly inspired by nature, and floral themes occur in most of his pieces. His jewellery can be roughly divided into two types: that with enamel, and that without. This piece is unusual with a large upside down amethyst heart and set with small green garnets.\r\n\r\n<article id=""post-164"" class=""post-164 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-inglenookery-jewellery-for-sale-on-etsy tag-arthur-and-georgie-gaskin tag-arthur-gaskin tag-arts-and-crafts tag-arts-and-crafts-jewellery tag-bernard-cuzner tag-bernard-instone tag-bernard-instone-ring tag-birmingham-jewellery tag-birmingham-school-of-art tag-georgie-gaskin tag-inglenookery tag-inglenookery-shop-on-etsy tag-instone-jewellery tag-instone-ring tag-john-paul-cooper tag-my-etsy-shop tag-sibyl-dunlop tag-sybil-dunlop tag-the-gaskins tag-va-museum tag-victoria-and-albert-museum tag-vittoria-street"">\r\n<div class=""entry-content"">\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=""wp-caption-text"">.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n</article><nav id=""nav-below""></nav>"	1875	1875	N/A 	instock	41301,41302,41303	simple	green-garnet/metals/silver/enamel/amethyst	mid-century	antique-lockets-pendants	female	N/A

It was made circa 1908-1915 and has a silver loop with Russian marks for St Petersburg 1908-1917. The manufacturing process for goldstone was invented in seventeenth-century Venice by the Miotti family.\xa0\xa0 A goldstone amulet from 12th-century Persia shows that other, earlier artisans were also able to create the material. The most common form of goldstone is reddish-brown, containing tiny crystals of metallic copper that require special conditions to form properly. The initial batch is melted together from silica, copper oxide, and other metal oxides to chemically reduce the copper ions to elemental copper. \xa0The vat is then sealed off from the air and the glass is kept hot enough to remain liquid while allowing metallic crystals to precipitate\xa0from solution without melting or oxidising. \xa0After some time the entire batch is cooled to a single solid mass, which is then broken out of the vat for selection and shaping. The best material is near the centre of the mass, ideally with large, bright metal crystals suspended in a semitransparent glass matrix.	250	250	N/A 	instock	45059,45060,45061	simple	silver/metals	N/A	antique-charms	N/A	easter-gifts

35822	119H	Art Deco 18ct Gold, Platinum, Rose Diamond &amp; Synthetic Sapphire Crested Intaglio Ring	publish	sold	https://www.antiquejewellerycompany.com/shop/art-deco-18ct-gold-platinum-rose-diamond-synthetic-sapphire-crested-intaglio-ring	An impressive signet ring that was made in the 1920s in America. It is set with a synthetic sapphire.\r\n\r\nThe history of the synthetic gemstone is interesting. In 1873 Auguste Verneuil, who was based at the Museum of Natural History in Paris, began to work to synthesize corundum. In 1876, after many experiments, ruby synthesis was understood and repeatable although it was not understood how sapphire, called, \x93bug juice\x94 synthesis took place. The blue corundum colour that was created was not a fine blue colour and the process could not be repeated.\r\n\r\nIn 1886, Verneuil, a gem expert and Fremy worked together with Jannettez while they were still at the Paris Museum of Natural History. Verneuil came to realize that fusing powdered alumina and chromium with the oxygen hydrogen torch made synthetic corundum.\r\n\r\nAt some point between 1886 and 1892, Verneuil discovered flame fusion. Later he realized that using different elements would create other synthetic gemstones such as synthetic ruby.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Vernueil realized that synthetic sapphires could be created with the addition of iron and titanium and in 1911, he and his employer, the Heller Company, were given two patents for this discovery.\r\n\r\nSo this was a revolution in the gem industry and many pieces of jewellery made after 1909 and well into the 1920s and later were often set with a mixture of synthetic and natural stones. It was acceptable and was often used to get the right colour match.\r\n\r\nIn signet rings such as this example the synthetic stone has been beautifully cut with an intaglio of a crest.	1875	1875	N/A 	instock	35823,37561,35931,35933,35932,35934	simple	platinum/precious-stones/diamond/metals/gold	art-deco	antique-seals-signet-rings	male	dandy-man

They have been engraved in the reverse with four Irish terriers. A reverse crystal intaglio is a rock crystal cabochon with an intaglio carved into the flat back. The intaglio was also painted realistically with oils so, that when viewed through the top, the image appears three-dimensional. Finally, the back was sealed in order to preserve the painted areas. The technique originated in Belgium c. 1860 and is attributed to an artist named Emile Marius Pradier.  This technique was also practiced in England by Thomas Cook and his descendants who made crystals for Lambeth &amp; Co.\r\nProduction of a reverse crystal intaglio begins with the mining and cutting of fine rock crystal from Brazil or Madagascar. A well-formed cabochon is the key to a beautifully made reverse intaglio and the tedious process of hand polishing it to perfection had to be completed before the design work could begin. A watercolour of the image was painted on the underside of the cabochon and an oil and diamond dust mixture was used along with up to 250 scribing tools to carve the design into the interior of the crystal ""...the deeper the carving the more pronounced trompe l\"	2500	2500	N/A 	instock	52056,52057,52055,52060,52061,52059,52058	simple	metals/rock-crystal/gold	art-deco	antique-cufflinks	male	dandy-man

54308	795K	French Art Deco Synthetic Sapphire &amp; Diamond Cluster Ring	publish	available	https://www.antiquejewellerycompany.com/shop/french-art-deco-synthetic-sapphire-diamond-cluster-ring	I am fascinated by synthetic stones as the process is brilliant and complex. The Parisian chemist Auguste Verneuil collaborated with Fremy on developing the method, but soon went on to independently develop the flame fusion process, which would eventually come to bear his name. In 1909, Vernueil realised that synthetic sapphires could be created with the addition of iron and titanium and in 1911, he and his employer, the Heller Company, were given two patents for this discovery. So this beautifully made platinum ring is set with a wonderful and very convincing sapphire  which is synthetic but looks like a Kashmir sapphire. It is surrounded by good white and well matched diamonds with a small diamond on each shoulder. These stones were widely used in the 1920s especially in France. What a beautiful engagement ring this would be for the price! 	1875	1875	N/A 	instock	54309,54331,54417,54420,54419,54415,54416,54418	simple	platinum/precious-stones/diamond/metals/sapphire	art-deco	antique-engagement-rings	female	N/A

It is a brilliant cut diamond with single cut diamond stepped sides. Palladium is a rare metal from the same family as platinum, it was discovered in 1803 by English chemist William Hyde Wollaston whilst analysing samples of platinum ore, that were obtained in South America. Hyde named it palladium after the asteroid Pallas.\r\nPalladium only gained its own hallmark in July 2009. There are only four precious metals that require a hallmark; silver, gold, platinum, and now palladium.\r\nPalladium, like platinum is a noble bright white metal and it is therefore not affected by oxygen, meaning that it does not rust nor does it corrode. It also means that most acids will not penetrate it and damage the metal, keeping its brightness.\r\nPalladium is about thirty times rarer than gold, and fifteen times rarer than platinum.\r\nThis ring is a modern ring in the Art Deco style and is a beautiful design. It would be ideal as an engagement ring.	5250	5250	N/A 	instock	50915,51205,51122,51125,51126,51121,51120,51124,50967,51123	simple	precious-stones/diamond	modern	antique-engagement-rings	female	N/A

A reverse crystal intaglio is a rock crystal cabochon with an intaglio carved into the flat back. The intaglio was also painted realistically with oils so, that when viewed through the top, the image appears three-dimensional. Finally, the back was sealed in order to preserve the painted areas. The technique originated in Belgium c. 1860 and is attributed to an artist named Emile Marius Pradier. This technique was also practiced in England by Thomas Cook and his descendants who made crystals for Lambeth &amp; Co.\r\nProduction of a reverse crystal intaglio begins with the mining and cutting of fine rock crystal from Brazil or Madagascar. A well-formed cabochon is the key to a beautifully made reverse intaglio and the tedious process of hand polishing it to perfection had to be completed before the design work could begin. A watercolour of the image was painted on the underside of the cabochon and an oil and diamond dust mixture was used along with up to 250 scribing tools to carve the design into the interior of the crystal \x93\x85the deeper the carving the more pronounced trompe l\x92oeil effect.\x94 Once the carving was established the painting process began with extremely fine brushes and paint working in reverse to create incredibly detailed images.\r\nThe motifs most commonly found are sporting themes \x96 horses, dogs, foxes and birds. This relatively secret process passed through family members, so keeping it exclusive and expectations of quality were very high. They remained in fashion until poorly made glass and plastic imitations flooded the market c. 1920s. They were made circa 1900-1910. These cufflinks are very collectable today.	2950	2950	N/A 	instock	22718,22719,22720,22721	simple	metals/rock-crystal/gold	edwardian	antique-cufflinks	male	dandy-man

His wings and upper body are faceted Vauxhall glass with an edging of round glass and glass eyes. There are two kite registration marks underneath which is unusual. During the Victorian Era a diamond-shaped Design Registration Mark (1842-1883), known as a ""kitemark"" was used on jewellery and other decorative arts. These marks were stamped to indicate the date a particular design was registered, similar to a patent mark. Kitemarks from 1842-1867 consisted of the ""Class"" at the top within a circle, the ""Year"" at the top, the ""Month"" at the left point, ""Day"" at the right and ""Bundle"" number at the bottom. From 1868-1883 the ""Day"" was at the top, ""Bundle"" on the left, ""Year"" on the right and ""Month"" at the bottom. This practice stopped in 1884. I think this bug dates from around 1870.\r\n"	675	675	N/A 	instock	47957,48358,48357	simple	paste	victorian	antique-brooches	male	N/A

This type of work is known as Swiss enamel. Many pieces were made for the burgeoning tourist market during the 19th century. Travellers would be able to purchase mountain scenery or Swiss girls and boys dressed in Cantonal costume, all beautifully painted in enamel on gold. This piece is comparatively rare as it features a cherub hovering in the night sky. He is surrounded by floral Forget-Me-Nots with a black enamel background. The sky is incredibly well done. It looks like the twinkling effect of goldstone, but it is in fact all painted in enamel. We have never seen this technique before on a Swiss enamel piece. The reverse contains a locket section with a lock of blonde and another of brunette hair bound together with fine gold thread, which leads us to conclude that it is a mourning piece made for a couple.	1875	1875	N/A 	instock	25618,25619,25620,25621	simple	metals/enamel/gold	georgian	antique-brooches	female	forget-me-not

It is an Australian sapphire so it is quite dark blue with greenish flashes in certain light. It is surrounded by good evenly matched white diamonds. It was made circa 1950. The mines of Australia have produced more commercial-grade blue sapphire than any other source in history. The typical Australian sapphire is dark blue color with a strong green dichroism, and color zoning. Crystals average about three carats in size. Deposits are located in two main areas on the eastern part of the continent. The gem fields at Anakie in Queensland, and the New England district of New South Wales. After the late 1970s, sapphire production in Queensland declined as new sources were developed in Thailand and Madagascar.	2950	2950	N/A 	instock	27412,27430,27431,27432,27433,27434,27435,27437,27436	simple	precious-stones/diamond/metals/gold/sapphire	mid-century	antique-engagement-rings	female	N/A

The story behind the Claddagh is In the early 16th century an Irish man by the name of Richard Joyce was fishing off the coast of Galway a week before he was to be married when his currach (boat) capsized. Richard was captured by pirates, taken to West Africa and sold into slavery to a Moorish goldsmith. Years passed and Richard escaped captivity and returned home to Ireland to find that the girl he loved had never married. Richard shaped a unique ring for the girl he left behind. The ring was fashioned of three symbols: the hands signifying Friendship, holding a heart signifying love, topped with a crown for loyalty. Richard and his love married and settled in the village of Claddagh. The village no longer exists but since those early days the Claddagh ring has been worn as a sign of Love, Loyalty and Friendship. When wearing the ring the heart pointed toward you means your heart is taken, the heart pointed away from you means your heart is free. 	375	375	N/A 	instock	27496,34430,27497,27498,27499,27500,27501	simple	metals/gold	modern	antique-rings	male	i-love-you

During the early days the company manufactured very traditional jewellery. The quality was excellent and the company steadily gained new customers. However, the competition in the jewellery business was fierce. Mr. Anttila soon realised the future was not in the traditional style gold jewellery and getting any exposure in the international markets would require more original design. He had been following the work of Bj\xf6rn Weckstr\xf6m since the days of the Finnish Goldsmith School and was inspired by his unique touch in design. The two started to work together in 1963. These earrings are designed by Bj\xf6rn Weckstr\xf6m and are very wearable and do not date.	450	450	N/A 	instock	27867,27868,27869	simple	metals/gold	modern	antique-earrings	female	N/A

The baby turtles are coming out of the 18ct gold shell. They are carved labradorite and their eyes are set with tiny, round onyx. \r\n<p>Labradorite is a member of the Feldspar family and is treasured for its remarkable play of colour, known as labradorescence. The stone, usually grey-green, dark grey, black or greyish-white, is composed in aggregate layers that refract light as iridescent flashes of peacock blue, gold, pale green, or coppery red. It was first discovered in Labrador, Canada, by Moravian missionaries in 1770 who named it for the area. It is, however, referenced in legends by older Inuit tribes.</p>\r\n<p>These cufflinks are a clever example of the iridescent use of the stone when carved in to baby turtles.</p>	2950	2950	N/A 	instock	28106,28108,28109,28107	simple	labradorite/metals/gold	modern	antique-cufflinks	male	N/A

A workshop to make jewellery was opened over the store in 1887. Henry Birks and Sons also published its first annual catalogue in 1896. The next year the company purchased Hendery and Leslie, along with its designs, equipment, and labour force. Thereafter the company founded by Birks produced its own merchandise. From then on the volume of business increased. Noticing that a large number of mail orders came from Ottawa, in 1901 the company opened a store there, its first outside Montreal. This move would be repeated many times, and before World War II the company would in effect enjoy a monopoly over the market for gold and silver articles in the country.</p>\r\n\r\n	675	675	N/A 	instock	28553,28552,28554,28555,28557,28558,28556	simple	precious-stones/diamond/metals/gold/citrine	art-deco	antique-engagement-rings	female	N/A
